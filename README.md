<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is a variant of turn-based gameplay with a twist. Players have dedicated turns for moving and shooting separately, as well as action turn for showing the aftermath of their actions.

This project features destructible 2D environment, a bazooka-type weapon and a 3D animated character made in Blender, which was then exported as a spritesheet. Controls: WASD and arrows for the other player.

Project is a prototype that I hope to soon or later revisit.

### Built With

Godot 4.2 using GDScript
